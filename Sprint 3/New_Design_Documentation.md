## Data Design
- For this project, we don't use a database. Instead, we made direct request to the APIs and return the results to the front-end to be displayed

## Business Rules
- Our application is based on an open-source platform, people will be have the capability to modify the codes.
## User Interface Design
![user interface](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7579d31725c01c8f0affd517848d492b800c19e8/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f526d7a435a4b362e6a7067)

## Resource Management
- We use Python (Flask) instead of Angular to request and extract data from the APIs for each component (such as Clock, Date, Weather ect..) because it enables us to show only the necessary information we need to display to the front-end for each component instance. This keeps data parsing code out of our frontend rendering logic.
## Security
- As a security measure, We have all the API Keys stored locally instead of having them in github.
## Performance
## Scalability
## Interoperability
## Internationalization/Localization
## Input/Output
## Error Processing
## Fault Tolerance
## Architectural Feasibility
## Overengineering
## Build-vs-Buy Decisions
We used both Angular and Flask as a third party libraries in our system.
- Angular- Allows us to modularize frontend and request data from each respective frontend component separately.
- Flask- Received HTTP request and called those methods for those instances. 
## Reuse
## Change Strategy
